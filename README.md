In this project, I explore [a dataset of 28K financial tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/davidwallach/financial-tweets/data), provided with the courtesy of David Wallach.

**The goal of this project is to explore the dataset.** That is, to understand _what are the kind_ of tweets in this dataset. 

To do that, I use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to clean and cluster the data. I also use my general knowledge of financial markets to analyze in human words the outcome of the model. 

I find that :
- This model allows us to find relevant tweets about news in the technology sector, and tweets about market predictions.
- Data collection is flawed : the dataset contains lots of promotional tweets for cryptocurrency exchanges.
- The model I built is susceptible to tweets spamming the same irrelevant keywords. 

I suggest ways to overcome these issues. At the end of this exploration, I gained valuable knowledge to build more robust data collection pipelines and NLP models.
