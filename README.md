In this proejct, I analyze [a dataset of 28K financial tweets provided with the courtesy by David Wallach](https://www.kaggle.com/davidwallach/financial-tweets/data). 

**The goal of this project is to explore the dataset.** That is, to understand _what are the kind_ of tweets in this dataset. 

To do that, I use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, as well as some general knowledge about financial markets.

I find that :
- This model allows us to find relevant tweets about news in the technology sector, and tweets about market predictions.
- Data collection is flawed : the dataset contains lots of promotional tweets for cryptocurrency exchanges.
- The model I built is susceptible to tweets spamming the same irrelevant keywords. 

I suggest ways to overcome these issues. At the end of this exploration, I gain valuable knowledge to build more robust data collection pipelines and NLP models.

Thanks again to David Wallach for this interesting dataset !
